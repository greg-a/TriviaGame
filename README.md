# TriviaGame
This is a Movie themed trivia game that gives you 10 seconds to answer each question. At the end of the questioning you will see your totals showing how you did. Each question has a picture or gif that shows after the time is up or you click on an answer. If you get it wrong the picture gives you a clue of what the correct answer was.

Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with your screen. I added a background filter to add grainy effect(like an old movie).
